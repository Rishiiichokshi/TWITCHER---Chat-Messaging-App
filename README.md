The problem it solves: Speed A chat application allows you to message or contact a person in real-time. In some cases, it becomes the bridge on where customers, potential leads, prospects could ask inquiries about products or services, and you can respond instantly.

Convenience You can seamlessly blend a chat application into your everyday agendas. You can reach out or respond to an inquiry from your computer or mobile device, close the app, and return to whatever you are doing.

Privacy Chat applications such as WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Facebook Messenger, Viber, and Telegram are all direct channels where information is private and secure. Customers donâ€™t have to worry about anyone seeing their private information â€” including the messaging company itself! Messaging apps with end-to-end encryption offer data protection so secure that you can discuss any customer service issue with no worries.

Socialize Online communication can help young people build and develop social skills and gives them a platform to share their skills and help each other out.

Challenges I ran into: we have implented a "barcode scanner" for that we need many permission from the ide as well as in the device so for that we did lot of R&D for that.

integrating the api is also no the easy task for that we approached many firms for some good and private api but we did not get any of that and we used an open source database which is very private and user friendly.

We have tried for file transfer but we haven't got any public API so we dropped the idea.

Technologies I used: Firebase, JAVA, Google FCM API
